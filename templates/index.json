We wanted to keep our dogs comfortable in the car while keeping our vehicle clean, but we couldn’t find a good solution. Regular seat covers just couldn't stand up to the dog fur, nails, and muddy messes that come along with so many adventures. <\/p><p>We knew we weren’t the only ones with this problem, so we set out to solve it. Starting in 2013 and after more than 11 iterations, we found the perfect prototype for a durable, high-quality dog seat cover that will withstand any adventure and last for years to come.<\/p>",
