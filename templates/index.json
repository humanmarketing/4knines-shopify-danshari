We wanted to keep our dogs comfortable in the car while keeping our vehicle clean, but we couldn’t find a good solution. Regular seat covers just couldn't stand up to the dog fur, nails, and muddy messes that come along with so many adventures. <\/p><p>We knew we weren’t the only ones with this problem, so we set out to solve it. Five years and more than 11 iterations later, we found the perfect prototype for a durable, high-quality dog seat cover that will withstand any adventure and last for years to come.<\/p>",
