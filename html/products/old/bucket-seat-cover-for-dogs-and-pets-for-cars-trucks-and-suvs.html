The&nbsp;optional strap that goes around the back of the seat (not shown in&nbsp;diagram) should not be used in&nbsp;seats with airbags.&nbsp;<strong>All vehicles are different,&nbsp;so</strong>&nbsp;<strong>we</strong>&nbsp;<strong>recommend installing the seat cover to ensure it does not cover where your airbag deploys</strong>.</em></span></p>
