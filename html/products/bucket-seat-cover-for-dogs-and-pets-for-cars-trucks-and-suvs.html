The optional strap that goes around the back of the seat (not shown in diagram) should not be used in seats with airbags. <strong>All vehicles are different, so</strong> <strong>we</strong> <strong>recommend installing the seat cover to ensure it does not cover where your airbag deploys</strong>.</em></span></p>
