<p style="text-align: center; color: #ff0000;"><em>A note about airbags: 4Knines bucket seat covers do not cover the side of the seat back (where most side airbags are housed), so the cover should work well in most vehicles. The optional strap that goes around the back of the seat (not shown in diagram) should not be used in seats with airbags. <strong>All vehicles are different, so</strong> <strong>we</strong> <strong>recommend installing the seat cover to ensure it does not cover where your airbag deploys</strong>.</em></p>
