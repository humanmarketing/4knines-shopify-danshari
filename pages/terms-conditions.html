<p>4Knines, LLC (“4Knines”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is in the business of developing innovative products for canines and their owners under the 4Knines® brand.  4Knines is a pioneer in the field of vehicle seat covers. For example, 4Knines was the first to design, manufacture, and sell vehicle covers that are adaptable to multiple vehicle seat configurations, namely via sections that can be used with various 60-40 or 40-20-40 split bench seats.  By virtue of its patent portfolio, 4Knines is the only legally authorized provider of such adaptable vehicle seat covers in the United States.</p>
<p>4Knines has built its products and brand on a foundation of intellectual property rights. For example, 4Knines is the owner of, including but not limited to: U.S. Trademark Registration Nos. 5,610,146, Reg. No. 4,582,042; U.S. Copyright Registration Nos. VAu001237476, VAu001237471,  VAu001238076,  V9937D981; and U.S. Patent No. 9,878,646, U.S. Patent No. 9,815,395, U.S. Patent No. 9,845,033, U.S. Patent No. 9,610,877, U.S. Patent No. 9,963,086, Publication No. 2018/0251054, and Publication No. 2019/0016244. 4Knines takes the protection of its intellectual property rights very seriously and aggressively enforces its patent, trademark, and copyright rights.</p>
<p>4Knines actively pursues individuals, manufacturers, and their trade partners who infringe on their intellectual property rights. By way of example, 4Knines recently successfully enforced its rights in relation to its ‘646 adaptable seat cover patent against an infringer in the case styled: 4Knines, LLC v. Spark Prodigy, LLC, Civil Action No. 2:18-CV-02714, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee.  Infringers put themselves at risk for substantial monetary damages which can include up to three times our damages plus legal costs. 4Knines actively monitors other products in the market and will pursue any potential infringers.</p>
