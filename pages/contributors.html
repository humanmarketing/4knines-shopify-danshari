      <p>Many years ago, I received the greatest gift I have ever received from another human being. I named that gift Chico. Since then, my husband and I have given a fur-ever home to other Chihuahuas and we now have three. Chihuahuas became my passion!</p>
      <p>Knowing that Chihuahuas are the <a href="https://www.chichisandme.com/why-are-chihuahuas-the-second-most-euthanized-breed">second most euthanized breed</a> in America—second only to Pit Bulls—it soon became my mission to do something to change these sad statistics and to help educate Chihuahua parents, owners, and guardians. That is when I began my full-time career as a professional blogger and launched my website <a href="http://www.chichisandme.com">Chichisandme.com</a>.</p>
      <p>Along with my years of experience, I work closely with others in the pet community and with experts in training. I have volunteered at our local shelter in several departments, including working with the training team.I now work part-time at a Veterinary Hospital.</p>
      <p>I am very passionate about all dogs’ overall health, physical, mental, and emotional, with a special emphasis on the Chihuahua breed.</p>

      <p><b>CDT, CHHC, Published Author “Get Your Leash On!”</b></p>
      <p>I am a dog trainer and health coach for teams of people and their dogs. I am the author of “Get Your Leash On!” which is a guide to living a happy and healthy lifestyle with your dog. Knowing how to train with your dog to do basic dog training behaviors, and how to SAFELY train with your dog to get moving is important to a longer and happier life together, combining that with healthier ways of eating as a team. Cooking once for your dog and yourself instead of making two meals is less time consuming and more fun! I share my life with four dogs, I call them my 4 American dogs. Scout and Liberty are my two American Foxhound “mixes” (although if you ever heard their bay/ howl you’d drop the “mix” as well). They came to me via way of the Smithtown Hunting Club (who uses American Foxhounds in their events) and Kent Animal Shelter. Then there is Freedom- my Shepherd Mix who thinks she is Scout’s mini me- and then finally Justice, who is my GSD. We typically run anywhere from 3- 6 miles a day together. I one day hope to become the internet’s go-to dog-and-human-team health coach so I can help teams live together longer, changing the world around us to be that much better. Can we elect a dog in office one day? LOL!</p>
